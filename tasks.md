Tasks

Aayush
- [x] Write a minimal GPU-friendly graph library (use classes not structs)
   - [x] Implement adjacency matrices (linearized representation)
   - [x] Implement a structure to represent a path
   - [x] Auxiliary graph operations (get neighbors, calc path weight, etc...)
   - [x] Write dataloader for TSP dataset(s)

Matt
- [ ] Implement generic ACO algorithm
- [ ] Implement ACO for TSP on the CPU, sequentially
- [ ] Write tests

Finish by Sunday night

Later:
- [ ] Implement ACO for TSP on the GPU, using parallelism
- [ ] Benchmark
   - [ ] Benchmark the CPU impl
   - [ ] Benchmark the real GPU impl
- [ ] Compare correctness (how are we going to do this?)
- [ ] Search the project for `TODO` since I added some potential stuff
