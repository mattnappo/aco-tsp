Tasks

Aayush
- [ ] Write a minimal GPU-friendly graph library (use classes not structs)
   - [x] Implement adjacency matrices (linearized representation)
   - [x] Implement a structure to represent a path
   - [ ] Auxiliary graph operations (get neighbors, calc path weight, etc...)
   - [ ] Write dataloader for TSP dataset(s)

Matt
- [ ] Implement generic ACO algorithm
- [ ] Implement ACO for TSP on the CPU, sequentially

Finish by Sunday night

Later:
- [ ] Implement ACO for TSP on the GPU, using parallelism
- [ ] Benchmark
   - [ ] Benchmark the CPU impl
   - [ ] Benchmark the real GPU impl
- [ ] Compare correctness (how are we going to do this?)
