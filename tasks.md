Tasks
- [ ] Write a minimal GPU-friendly graph library
   - [ ] Implement adjacency lists
   - [ ] Implement a structure to represent a path
   - [ ] Auxiliary graph operations (get neighbors, calc path weight, etc...)
- [ ] Implement generic ACO algorithm
- [ ] Implement ACO for TSP on the CPU, sequentially
- [ ] Implement ACO for TSP on the GPU, sequentially (should we even do this?)

- [ ] Benchmark
   - [ ] Write dataloader for TSP dataset(s)
   - [ ] Benchmark the CPU impl
   - [ ] Benchmark the sequential GPU impl
   - [ ] Benchmark the real GPU impl
- [ ] Compare correctness (how are we going to do this?)
